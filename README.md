# Animal Helper

Animal Helper is an open-source, non-profit system for reporting suspected
animal cruelty, animals in distress, and injured wildlife, and for helping
volunteers route those reports to the appropriate organisations.

This repository is deliberately **documentation-first**. Product flows and
visual designs are owned by the wider project team and will be integrated when
the Figma work is ready. The current foundation defines the boundaries that make
those screens safe and maintainable.

## System at a glance

- **Customer PWA:** mobile-first, anonymous and offline-capable. A reporter may
  submit a case and later observe its status through an unguessable capability.
- **Backoffice PWA:** desktop/tablet-oriented and authenticated. Administrators
  triage cases, prepare jurisdiction-specific documents, and dispatch reviewed
  communications.
- **Central API:** owns commands, authorisation, workflow transitions,
  projections, and asynchronous jobs.
- **Persistence:** PostgreSQL stores event streams, projections, outbox entries,
  and erasable private data. Private object storage holds media.

The first locale and jurisdiction are Slovak (`sk-SK`, Slovakia), but language
resources and jurisdiction rules are separate packages.

```

Vercel receives only static application assets. Sensitive case traffic goes
directly to the API and private object storage. This is both a privacy boundary
and a portability choice.

## Local development

Node.js 24 LTS and pnpm 11.18.0 are pinned for deterministic builds. pnpm 11
imports `node:sqlite`, which older Node 23 builds (including Homebrew 23.1) do
not provide.

```sh
# Homebrew (keg-only; keep this on PATH in the project shell)
brew install node@24
export PATH="$(brew --prefix node@24)/bin:$PATH"

corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@11.18.0 --activate
pnpm install
pnpm check
```

If `pnpm` dies with `Cannot find package node:sqlite`, the `node` on `PATH` is
not 24. Check with `node --version`.

The executable foundation is a framework-free domain core, versioned
case-command contracts, a local PostgreSQL event store, a loopback HTTP API, and
a Vue customer shell for the injured/stray walk.

Local Postgres is Docker Compose (`postgres:16-alpine` on loopback port 55432).
A running Docker Engine with Compose v2 is required. Homebrew Postgres and the
Supabase CLI are not. `npm run dev` starts that container, applies migrations,
serves the API on `http://127.0.0.1:8787`, and serves the customer app on
`http://127.0.0.1:5173`. Ctrl+C stops the API and Vite only; the database stays
up.

```sh
pnpm db:up
npm run dev
```

In another terminal:

```sh
pnpm check
```

Stop the API and Vite with Ctrl+C. Stop the database when you no longer need it:

```sh
pnpm db:down
```

Production uses Neon in a European region. See
[Persistence](docs/operations/persistence.md) and
[ADR 0008](docs/architecture/decisions/0008-docker-local-neon-prod.md).
