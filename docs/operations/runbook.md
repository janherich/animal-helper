# Initial operations runbook

This is a skeleton to be made executable during the platform spike. It names the
operational responsibilities that must not remain implicit.

## Environments

| Environment | Data                     | External delivery                      | Purpose                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| local       | generated synthetic only | captured locally/test provider         | development and integration tests |
| preview     | generated synthetic only | fixed allow-list of team addresses     | pull-request acceptance           |
| production  | real reports             | reviewed authority/reporter recipients | controlled pilot and service      |

No database copy flows from production to preview or local. Synthetic generators
must cover debugging and demos.

## Deployment

1. CI verifies format, lint, type checks, unit/integration tests, build,
   migrations, and security checks.
2. Apply backward-compatible database migrations.
3. Deploy API/functions and workers.
4. Run synthetic command/upload/outbox smoke tests.
5. Deploy immutable PWA assets.
6. Observe error/outbox/cleanup metrics.
7. Complete any destructive migration only in a later release after old code is
   retired.

Roll forward by default. Database migrations require a documented recovery path;
application rollback must not cause old code to misread new events.

## Daily checks during pilot

- oldest pending/failed outbox item;
- oldest incomplete deletion;
- orphan/staging media count and age;
- provider quota/budget alerts;
- administrator authentication anomalies;
- API error/rate-limit trend;
- most recent successful production smoke test.

## Incident priorities

1. protect reporters and stop further disclosure or destructive effects;
2. preserve minimal, safe evidence and revoke affected sessions/keys;
3. establish scope without copying case contents into chat or issue trackers;
4. assess controller/provider/legal notification duties;
5. restore safe operation and verify queued commands/outbox items;
6. record lessons and update the threat model.

Kill switches are required for new intake, media upload, administrator export,
outbound dispatch, and public status independently.

## Provider outage

- Customer: keep a bounded local draft/queue and clearly say it is not yet
  received.
- API/database: stop claiming submission; preserve command IDs for retry.
- Object store: retain local blobs and do not submit incomplete media
  references.
- Email: retain an idempotent outbox item and show delayed delivery to admin.
- Static host: publish service status through a separately controlled minimal
  channel once one is selected.

## Key compromise

Maintain an inventory mapping each key to owner, environment, scope, creation,
last rotation, and revocation procedure. On suspected exposure:

1. disable or rotate the key at the provider;
2. stop affected functionality if rotation is not atomic;
3. inspect provider audit metadata without exporting report bodies;
4. replace environment secrets and redeploy;
5. invalidate derived signed URLs/sessions where possible;
6. complete breach assessment.

Removing a secret from Git or redeploying without rotation is insufficient.

## Data recovery

The free Supabase tier has no automatic backups. If used for a pilot, the
operator must explicitly accept that accidental deletion/corruption may be
unrecoverable. Before broader production:

- choose backup frequency and recovery objectives;
- encrypt backups separately from provider credentials;
- include event store, private relational data, configuration, and object
  inventory;
- test restore into an isolated environment using synthetic validation;
- confirm retention/deletion obligations also apply to backups;
- record the last successful restore test.

## Ownership still to assign

- incident commander and privacy/legal contact;
- administrator account approver;
- authority directory/form reviewer;
- provider billing and quota owner;
- vulnerability-report recipient;
- backup/restore owner;
- data-retention exception approver.
