# ADR 0009: Passkeys for administrator authentication

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-09-08

## Context

Administrators must be individually named, allow-listed, and strongly
authenticated before they see case data. The baseline documents specified TOTP.
Passkeys with required user verification provide phishing-resistant
authentication without a second password or shared TOTP secret, and they match
the neighbouring Frames admin interface.

The backoffice is a static Vue PWA. Cookie sessions need a same-origin
relationship with the admin API: `SameSite=Strict` cookies are not sent on
cross-origin POSTs from `http://127.0.0.1:5173` to `:8787`, and those two ports
are same-site, so Fetch Metadata `same-site` must be rejected.

## Decision

- Authenticate operators with WebAuthn passkeys (`userVerification: required`,
  discoverable credentials / `residentKey: required`). Do not add TOTP.
- There is no public sign-up. A trusted CLI
  (`pnpm admin:bootstrap -- --email … [--open]`) creates or re-invites a named
  operator and writes a one-use, 15-minute token as a private `0600` HTML file.
  The bearer token is never printed.
- Ceremonies use an HttpOnly cookie (5 minutes) that is consumed even on
  failure. Sessions are opaque tokens stored as SHA-256 hashes, 30 minutes
  absolute, `SameSite=Strict`. Local cookies are `ah_dev_admin_{originHash}`;
  production uses `__Host-ah_admin` with `Secure`.
- CSRF protection is exact `Origin` plus Fetch Metadata: `cross-site` and
  `same-site` POSTs are rejected. There is no synchronizer token.
- The relying-party ID is the hostname of `ADMIN_ORIGIN`. Locally that is
  `localhost` (not `127.0.0.1`): IP addresses are not valid WebAuthn RP IDs, and
  Safari will reject passkeys there. The backoffice Vite app on port **5174**
  proxies `/admin` to the API on 8787 with `changeOrigin: false` so cookies stay
  first-party. The customer app on 5173 continues to call the reporter API with
  `credentials: omit`.
- Production requires `ADMIN_ORIGIN` as an exact `https` origin. Without it,
  admin routes stay disabled and the reporter API still starts. A later
  deployment should serve the admin SPA and admin API from that same origin.

The first backoffice slice is login plus a read-only case queue from
`ah.case_queue_projection` (workflow state and timestamps only, no private
payloads). Matrix editing and privileged commands remain later work.

## Consequences

Operators need a platform authenticator. Shared admin passwords and TOTP
enrolment are out of scope. Local development needs the 5174 proxy; calling
`/admin` directly on `:8787` is rejected because the `Host` header will not
match. Session idle timeout is not yet separate from the 30-minute absolute
lifetime. See [AH-SEC-011](../../security/security-requirements.md) and threat
model T11/T12.
