# Backoffice PWA

The backoffice is a desktop/tablet-oriented online Vue 3 + Vite PWA for
individually authenticated administrators. See
[ADR 0007](../../docs/architecture/decisions/0007-vue-static-pwas.md) and
[ADR 0009](../../docs/architecture/decisions/0009-passkey-admin-auth.md).

This slice is passkey login, a case queue with the reporter summary, a case
page for internal follow-up, and a guidance matrix that can edit injured copy,
toggle applicability, and publish. Opening a case audits the read. It does not
dispatch mail or store authority files; those stay as copied filenames.

`npm run dev` from the repository root starts Docker Postgres, the API on
`http://127.0.0.1:8787`, the customer app on `http://localhost:5173`, and this
app on `http://localhost:5174`. Vite proxies `/admin` to the API so session
cookies stay first-party. Open the backoffice at `http://localhost:5174`, not at
port 8787. Use `localhost`, not `127.0.0.1` — passkeys require that hostname.

Create a named operator (no public sign-up):

```sh
pnpm admin:bootstrap -- --email you@example.com --open
```

The command writes a private HTML file with a 15-minute, one-use setup link. It
does not print the token. After opening that file, register a platform passkey,
then sign in again later with the same authenticator.

Safari stores those keys against the RP ID `localhost`, shared with every other
local site. If login offers passkeys that never succeed, they are leftovers
(failed setup, another local app, or a database reset). Delete the `localhost`
passkeys for this address in Passwords, then register one new key from a
bootstrap link:

```sh
pnpm admin:bootstrap -- --email you@example.com --open --reset-passkeys
```

The queue lists case number, situation, species, place, and admin status. The
case page reads location, form snapshot, and contact from private records.
Newsletter consent is not shown. Admin notes, actions, referrals, and
inspections are stored in `ah.admin_case_work`.

**Matica sprievodcu** (`/guidance`) browses the code-owned
`@animal-helper/guidance` catalog and edits injured copy. Save writes a draft;
publish makes that revision the public `GET /guidance` payload. Preview uses the
same resolver as the customer walk. Stray and cruelty stay read-only. Rollback,
review-date gating, and jurisdiction phone snapshots are not in this slice.

Later technical responsibilities remain:

- present the least private data needed for queue triage;
- record auditable case transitions and restricted-data reads;
- select versioned Slovak routing/form definitions;
- roll back a published guidance revision and record subject-matter review;
- confirm exact recipient and content before an idempotent dispatch;
- make retention completion, outbox failures, and security warnings visible.

There is one permission role initially, but accounts remain individual.
Publication will be an authenticated, passkey-assured, audited operation; the
editor cannot create arbitrary screens, branches, HTML, or executable rules.
